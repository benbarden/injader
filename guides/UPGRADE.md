# Injader upgrade guide

## Get the files onto your site

Download the latest release zip file. Extract the contents.

Transfer the contents of the "upload" folder to your site via FTP.

## Open the installer folder

Open your site in a browser, and add /installer/ to the end of the URL.

Under "Upgrades", click the link to run the upgrade.

## Look for any on-screen notices

Most upgrades are very quick.

If you are upgrading multiple versions in one go, you may need to refresh the page a number of times to complete the process.

If asked to do this, hit Refresh once and wait for the next stage to come up.

## Tidying up

Delete the installer folder from your site.
