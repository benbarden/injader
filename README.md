# About Injader

Injader is an open source CMS for technical users.

It aims to provide a lightweight alternative to more mainstream products, such as WordPress and Drupal.

Injader may be a good option if you want a small, simple site.

# Code quality

The source code is undergoing a major overhaul. For at least the next few versions, don't be surprised if you find
some really bad code. I'm cleaning it up.
