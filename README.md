# About Injader

Injader is an open source CMS for technical users.

It aims to provide a lightweight alternative to more mainstream products, such as WordPress and Drupal.

# Why Injader?

I use WordPress, but I find it's overkill for small sites.

I use Tumblr, but I find it's too simplistic for some of the sites I'd like to set up.

Injader is not trying to be everything to everyone. In fact, it's not really trying to be much of
anything to anyone!

I think Injader is a good option if you want a small, simple site.

# History

With roots dating back to May 2005, no updates since 2010, and an original focus on non-technical users,
the existing codebase requires significant cleanup before it should be considered technically "good".

Despite the neglected state of the project, it's still a surprisingly fast CMS that uses a very small
amount of memory. This is why I decided to revive the project, but with a new focus.

# Future

The new Injader is really a fork of the original project, although you can still download the last
version (2.4.5) from Github.

I may upload a maintenance update or two (2.4.6) before moving onto the next stage.
The new versioning will probably start with 3.0.0 - it may not be a massive update, but it will
break ties with the old version.

# How you can help

Right now, I'd be surprised if anyone wants to help, but a couple of areas you might be able
to help with include:

* Importing data from other platforms - not really essential, but someone might want to do it.
The existing WordPress importer will be deleted shortly, but it can be found in 2.4.5 if you need it.
* Translations - there's nothing to translate just yet, and there's no translation engine either,
but once something's in place, perhaps you'd like to translate some stuff?
